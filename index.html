                <p id="question">
                    Picture this: You’re a recruiter looking for a top-notch computer science intern. You need someone
                    who is clever, self-driven, and a great teammate. Where should you begin your search?
                </p>
                <p id="answer">
                    You could start with one of the best undergraduate computer science programs in the states, at the
                    University of Utah. Alma mater to various giants of the field, Michael Cohen (li), Edwin
                    Catmull, Robert Adamson, and many others. You can’t go wrong with the U.
                </p>
                <p id="question">
                    Alright, I'm sold on the U. Now what type of student would make a good fit?
                </p>
                <p id="answer">
                    You want a student who is ready for a brand new challenge. You want a student who will ask
                    intelligent questions, and follow-up on your answers. You want a student who can break down their
                    work and efficiently summarize their efforts. You want a student who writes simple, clean, readable
                    code. You want someone like Griffin Zody.
                </p>
                <p id="question">
                    So... Who is Griffin Zody?
                </p>
                <p id="answer">
                    I’m glad you asked! Griffin (“G” to his buddies) is a full-time computer science major and
                    psychology minor. In his spare time, he practices new accents, reads sci-fi thrillers, and plays way
                    too much Valorant. His most recent reads are The Library at Mount Char and Come as You Are. And,
                    lucky for you, Griffin is on the hunt for a summer internship.
                </p>
                <p id="question">
                    Can he actually code?
                </p>
                <p id="answer">
                    I promise you, FizzBuzz won’t stump him.
                </p>
                <p id="question">
                    Sounds great! How can I find out more about Griffin?
                </p>
                <p id="answer">
                    You can find a copy of his resume here (li). You can contact him at his LinkedIn(li) or email
                    griffinzody123@gmail.com. He is excited about your opportunity, and will respond in between classes.
